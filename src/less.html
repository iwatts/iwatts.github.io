                <p>I first began experimenting with web development back in 2001. I was among the first classes in my school to take classes on web development and learning HTML. I have since been able to experiment and learn CSS and some Javascript and jQuery through personal projects and experiments, as well as a student at MATC.</p>

            <p>Most recently, my responsibilities as Front End Developer at EKR Agency match the qualifications you are seeking. As the Front End Developer, my responsibilities included styling mobile versions of client sites, and working in Laravel to develop templates for Microfocus. I assisted in the successful completion of a transition project for the new website of microfocus.com. My supervisor also relied on my ability to skin and format the sites content.</p>
